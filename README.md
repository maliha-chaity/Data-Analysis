# Machine-Learning-projects

About me:

My name is Maliha. I love to study and work in Machine Learning. In this repository, I have merely attempted to implement some of the basic machine learning algorithms. In future, I will add advanced level works in this repository. This will always be public for everyone so that people can learn from it if they need. I want to work as a data analyst. Besides, I have great passion for deep learning and want to do some great projects on this topic (for example, traffic sign classification, breast cancer classification and many more). I also want to do some novel deep learning projects, which have not been done before.

Linear and Logistic Regression:

In this folder, I have done some predictions on the seattle_weather1948-2017.csv file using both linear and logistic regression. Besides, I have predicted the GDPs for all countries in 2018 from modifiedGDP.csv file by training existing GDPs. Finally, I have stored all the datas of modifiedGDP.csv and predicted new GDPs for 2018 in new_GDP.csv file.

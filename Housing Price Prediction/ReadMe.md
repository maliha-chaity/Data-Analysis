In this project, I have taken 4 parameters as independent variables:

1. `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-teacher ratio by town

Depending on these 3 independent variables, our model will predic the prices of the houses (dependent variable `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes). Here, I have used Support Vector Regression model. However, other models may provide better results.

In this project, I have taken 4 parameters as independent variables:

RM: average number of rooms per dwelling

LSTAT: percentage of population considered lower status

PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town

Depending on these 3 independent variables, our model will predic the prices of the houses (dependent variable MEDV: median value of owner-occupied homes). Here, I have used Support Vector Regression model. However, other models may provide better results.

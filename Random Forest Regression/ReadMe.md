Random Forest Regression:

In this folder, I have used the random forest regression in order to do prediction on the seattle_weather1948-2017.csv dataframe. The same thing was done using both linear and logistic regression in the previos folder. It seems that, random forest performs much more better than linear and logistic regression.
